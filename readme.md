# Kaolbrec's Planck Layout

I've got issues with the default keymap.

1) There are a bunch of keys which aren't even included (home/end, pgup/pgdn)
2) Control, one of the most useful keys has been bumped right for a backlight key..
3) There's no right-shift!

There's other stuff but that's the basics.
